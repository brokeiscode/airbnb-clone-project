| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Users**  | user_id, first_name, last_name, email_address, password.           |
| Properties | property_id, physical_address, property_description, property_host |
| Bookings   | booking_id, booking_date, booking_price                            |

- A **user** can list multiple **properties**, **book** multiple properties and multiple **users** can interact about the **booking** of a **property**.
- A **property** belongs to a user and can be **booked** by multiple users.
- A **booking** belongs to a **property** and a property can have multiple **bookings**.
- A **payment** can be made for a **booking** by a **user** and a **user** will recieve payment for a **booking** of their listed **property**.
- A **review** can be submitted by a **user** for a **property** and a **review** can be submitted by a host(**user**) on a **user** who **booked** their **property**.

## Feature Breakdown

- **API Documentation**: The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard to ensure clarity and ease of integration. It allows both humans and computers to understand and interact with an API without needing to see the underlying code or network traffic.

- **User Authentication**: It allows secure user registration, authentication, and profile management. It ensures only authenticated users can access their protected resources.

- **Property Management**: Allows property admins to create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings. It making properties discoverable and manageable through the platform.

- **Booking System**: Enables users to book properties, modify booking details, and manage check-in/check-out schedules. It ensures detailed reservation process and ensures quality user experience for end users.

- **Payment Processing**: Handles payment transactions for property bookings, including integrations with payment gateways. This feature is critical for enabling monetization.

- **Review System**: Post and manage reviews for properties. Lets users post feedback and rate properties they've booked. It adds credibility to listings and helps other users make informed decisions based on past experiences.

- **Database Optimizations**: Implementing indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data and uses caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance. Together, these optimizations significantly improve system performance and scalability, especially under high user demand.

## API Security

Security is a top priority in this project to protect user data, maintain system integrity, and ensure safe financial transactions. The following security measures are implemented:

### Authentication

User identity is verified using secure token-based authentication. This ensures only verified users can access protected endpoints.

### Authorization

Role-based access control is enforced to define what actions each user can perform. E.g., users can only modify their own data or listings.

### Rate Limiting

API endpoints are rate-limited to prevent abuse, such as brute-force attacks and distributed denial-of-service attacks (DDoS) which protects system resources and increase reliability.

### Input Validation & Sanitization

All user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks, such as SQL injection or XSS. This safeguards the database from malicious data.

### HTTPS Enforcement

All API communication occurs over HTTPS to encrypt data in transit. This ensures that sensitive information (e.g., passwords) cannot be intercepted.

### Secure Payment Handling

Payments are processed using PCI-compliant gateways, ensuring financial data is securely handled and stored in accordance with industry standards.

### Token Expiry & Refresh

Short-lived access tokens and secure refresh mechanisms are used to minimize risk in the event of token leakage, while maintaining a smooth user experience.

In this project, security is important to protect user identity and access to private data. Prevention of unauthorized modifications or deletions of listings, fraudulent bookings and to secure reservation details. Also, to ensure the safety of financial transactions and user trust. Maintain data integrity, privacy, and protection against breaches.

## CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment/Delivery**. It is a development practice that automates the process of integrating code changes, running tests, and deploying updates.

For this project, CI/CD pipelines improve development efficiency, reduce human error, and enable faster and more reliable software delivery. With each code push, the pipeline automatically tests and deploys changes, ensuring consistent performance, easier collaboration, and faster feedback cycles.

### Tools Used

- **GitHub Actions** – Automates workflows such as testing, building, and deploying the application on each commit or pull request.
- **Docker** – Containerizes the application, ensuring consistency across development, staging, and production environments.

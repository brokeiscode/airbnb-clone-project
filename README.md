# airbnb-clone-project

## Project Overview

The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security.

## Project Goals

To enhance my expertise in modern software development practices. These tasks includes:

- Master collaborative team workflows using GitHub.
- Deepen my understanding of backend architecture and database design principles.
- Implement advanced security measures for API development.
- Gain proficiency in designing and managing CI/CD pipelines for efficient deployment.
- Strengthen my ability to document and plan complex software projects effectively.
- Develop an understanding of integrating technologies like Django, MySQL, and GraphQL in a unified ecosystem.

## Team Roles

**Backend Developer**:
Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.

**Database Administrator**:
Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.

**DevOps Engineer**:
Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.

**QA Engineer**:
Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.
